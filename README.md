### Task need done to customize smoothly
* Should use only one Chart library: d3
* Should use only one Map library: google map
* Should use only one Editor library: ckeditor
* Should use only one font icon that made by fontello.com or icomoon.io or other. Purpose make smallest size of icons. Default themes use much more font icon libraries, each is NOT light-weight.
* Design Setting button and swith button: may let them to footer bar(not used usually).

** Add "permission grant" module, component or directive.
** Customize authentication UI
